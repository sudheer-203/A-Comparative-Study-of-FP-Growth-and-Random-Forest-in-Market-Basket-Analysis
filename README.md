# A-Comparative-Study-of-FP-Growth-and-Random-Forest-in-Market-Basket-Analysis
A Comparative Study of FP-Growth and Random Forest in Market Basket Analysis explores the effectiveness of two popular techniques—FP-Growth for association rule mining and Random Forest for predictive modeling—in analyzing transactional data. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation based on metrics like accuracy, execution time, and interpretability, and visualization of results. It is implemented in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, MLxtend, pandas, and matplotlib. The study concludes with a comparative analysis highlighting the strengths and trade-offs of each method, aiming to provide insights into their practical application in retail and e-commerce scenarios.
